# credit-risk-classification

## Description
In this Challenge, I’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

##  Process

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
- Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
- Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
-Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:

    * Generate a confusion matrix.
    * Print the classification report.

- Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
